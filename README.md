# CS340-Client-Server-Development

How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

In this project, the CRUD file was built to be modular. I can take in any credentials to sign into MongoDB and access a database/collection. The functions were created to use with MongoDB to allow users to Create, Read, Update, and Delete documents. The advantage in making it modular is that this CRUD module could be easily used again on a future project. 

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

In the past, I have only used csv files as a database. In this project, I fed an existing csv or json database into MongoDB. A CRUD module was created to access it and connect it to a front end. Another first for me. Finally, I created a front end that connected to my Crud using plotly dash. In the future, I will likely consider using these tools to meet the needs of clients/users.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists are problem solvers, they help by creating things that help other people do their jobs better, faster, or easier. This project would help Grazioso Salvare find the best dogs for their training program. It would also help them to find them fast and gather all the necessary information.
